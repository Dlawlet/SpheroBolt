 IR communication tested:
    - IR communication works with the app but not the library
    - multiple bots can and receve msg simultaneously on the same channel
    - but a channel can be used for only one purpose 
    - multiple cots can brodcast on the same tupel of channels  (using the app) this create weird moves but doesn't crash the bots
